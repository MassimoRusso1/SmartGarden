# Automated Plant Watering System

## Introduction
Welcome to the Automated Plant Watering System repository! This project aims to create a system that automatically waters plants in a garden using a pump, pipe system, and a web server controlled by an Arduino.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an efficient and convenient solution for watering plants in a garden without the need for manual intervention. By automating the process, users can ensure their plants receive the appropriate amount of water at the right time, leading to healthier and more vibrant gardens.

## Features
- **Automated Watering**: The system automatically waters plants based on predefined schedules or environmental conditions.
- **Web Server Interface**: Users can control and monitor the watering system remotely through a web interface hosted on the Arduino.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can adjust watering schedules, duration, and other parameters to suit their specific needs.
- **Sensor Integration**: Optional integration with sensors such as moisture sensors to adjust watering based on soil conditions.
- **Fault Detection**: The system can detect and alert users to faults such as pump failures or water leakage.

## Components
- **Arduino Board**: Controls the operation of the watering system and hosts the web server.
- **Water Pump**: Responsible for pumping water from a reservoir to the plants.
- **Pipe System**: Distributes water from the pump to various areas of the garden.
- **Sensors** (Optional): Moisture sensors, temperature sensors, etc., for monitoring environmental conditions.
- **Power Supply**: Provides the necessary power to operate the system.
- **Enclosure**: Housing to protect the electronic components from environmental factors.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Setup Arduino**: Set up the Arduino board with the necessary libraries and dependencies.
3. **Connect Hardware**: Connect the water pump, pipe system, and any sensors to the Arduino.
4. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code to the board.
5. **Configure Web Server**: Modify the web server configuration as needed, including Wi-Fi settings and authentication.
6. **Deploy**: Deploy the system in your garden, ensuring proper placement of the pump and pipes.

## Usage
1. **Access Web Interface**: Connect to the Arduino's web server using a web browser on any device connected to the same network.
2. **Set Parameters**: Configure watering schedules, duration, and any other settings through the web interface.
3. **Monitor**: Monitor the system's operation and receive alerts for any issues or faults.
4. **Maintenance**: Regularly check and maintain the system, including refilling the water reservoir and cleaning components as needed.
